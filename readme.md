# Code Reuse in CF: Is Spaghetti Code still Spaghetti if it's DRY? with Gavin Pickin

## Online ColdFusion Meetup (coldfusionmeetup.com) for May 12, 2022

Find out the difference between DRY code and WET code, and what one is better, and more importantly, WHY. We write code one, but we read it over and over again, maintaining our code is 90% of the job... code reuse is our friend. You are already Re-using code, even if you didn't know you were. We'll learn about the different types of Code Reuse in ColdFusion, the pros and cons of each.
